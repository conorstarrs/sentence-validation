# Conor Starrs - Sentence Validation Assignment

This project provides a way to determine whether or not a string is valid, based on a set of rules. The core logic is in a Java class which, for ease of use, has been deployed as a serverless Lambda function on Amazon Web Services. I have also created a vanilla JavaScript UI for ease of interaction with the code. A user is given a full breakdown of the results after submitting a sentence for validation.

## Live Demo

Please visit https://assignment.conorstarrs.dev/ to view a live demo of the application where you can validate a sentence.

## Source code file structure

- SentenceValidationFunction/src/main - Code for the application's Lambda function, written in Java.
- SentenceValidationFunction/src/test - Unit tests for the application's Lambda function code. 
- template.yaml - A template that defines the application's AWS resources (infrastructure as code). 
- UI/index.html - A static HTML file for easy interaction with the AWS back end.
- UI/js/validatorservice.js - Vanilla JavaScript to dynamically update the HTML.

## More details

The AWS infrastructure for this project is generated by the SAM Framework (https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) through the SAM CLI. The template.yaml file is interpreted and automatically deployed to AWS through CloudFormation with SAM commands. It will deploy an API Gateway API, a Lambda function, an S3 bucket (for static UI files) and a CloudFront distribution.

## Run the unit tests

If you would like to run the unit tests, please download the source code from git, then run:

```bash
mvn test
